# Archived Sprint 1: Days 1-30 Highlights

1. **Implementing Vision Transformer (ViT) from Scratch**: Developing a deep understanding of the ViT architecture and translating theoretical concepts into functional code to create a ViT model using PyTorch.

2. **Training a Semantic Segmentation Model with Open3D**: Leveraging the Open3D library to train a semantic segmentation model on the SemanticKITTI dataset, involving data loading, transformation, and visualization tasks.

3. **Exploring Classic Control Tasks for Reinforcement Learning**: Delving into classic control environments to understand Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Temporal Difference (TD) learning, and Q-learning, implementing these concepts in Python using reinforcement learning techniques.

4. **Building a Multimodal GAN for Image Generation**: Constructing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) capable of generating images from text descriptions by combining pre-trained models such as CLIP and VQGAN, emphasizing multi-modal fusion and learning.
