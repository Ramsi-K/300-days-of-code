# Archived Sprint: Days 91-120 Highlights

1. **YOLOv3 Implementation**:

   - Focused on debugging and refining YOLOv3 components, including the loss function, target assignment, and bounding box handling.
   - Resolved dataset generation issues and verified mask populations, ensuring accurate object detection assignments across scales.
   - Successfully aligned image dimensions with grid sizes and tested loss calculations component-wise, progressing toward a robust YOLOv3 implementation.

2. **LunaNet3D Data Pipeline Enhancements**:

   - Implemented a balanced data loader with dynamic sampling, adaptive augmentation, and difficulty-based sampling.
   - Reduced training times significantly by optimizing GPU utilization and caching strategies, achieving 20 minutes per epoch for the minimal model.
   - Addressed issues in batching, indexing, and augmentation, culminating in the successful training of baseline and minimal models with custom data loaders.

3. **MLOps with ZoomCamp**:

   - Completed Week 3 assignments on orchestration, covering pipeline development, experiment tracking, and model management.
   - Overcame Docker setup challenges and fine-tuned workflows for effective orchestration.
   - Implemented MLflow logging for model and artifact tracking in both local and containerized environments.

4. **Paper-to-Code Repository Organization**:

   - Refactored and organized the repository with a master README, individual project documentation, requirements files, and environment setups.
   - Enhanced clarity and modularity, making the repository easier to navigate and extend for future projects.

5. **LeetCode Practice**:
   - Completed a series of SQL-based problems, strengthening query optimization and logical reasoning skills.
   - Solved problems on topics like employee bonuses, customer orders, and data aggregation.

### Key Themes

- **Efficient Pipelines**: Streamlined LunaNet3D and YOLOv3 workflows with improved data loaders, augmentation strategies, and debugging.
- **Scalable MLOps Practices**: Applied foundational concepts of orchestration and experiment tracking to real-world setups.
- **Repository Management**: Enhanced organization and documentation for long-term usability and professional presentation.
- **Consistent Skill Development**: Balanced technical learning with coding problem-solving to maintain diverse skill sets.
