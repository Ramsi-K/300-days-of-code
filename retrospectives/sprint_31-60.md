# Archived Sprint 2: Days 31-60 Highlights

1. **LunaNet3D - Medical Image Preprocessing**: Delved into data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization of the LUNA16 dataset. This sprint involved detailed exploration of medical images, working on CT scan fundamentals, and generating insightful 3D visualizations to better understand the dataset. I tackled tasks like thresholding, segmentations, and transformations.

2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with PyG**: Completed various tasks with GNNs using PyTorch Geometric (PyG), such as node and graph classification, understanding spectral graph convolutions, and working on point cloud classification using PointNet++. Key projects included GAT models and link prediction on the MovieLens dataset.

3. **LeetCode DSA Practice**: Strengthened problem-solving skills by solving LeetCode problems on topics such as permutations, binary search, and array manipulations. Continued sharpening algorithmic thinking with hands-on exercises in preparation for coding interviews.

4. **3D Object Detection**: Explored 3D object detection by implementing models like Frustum PointNets and VoteNet. These models are key for real-time object detection in 3D environments, using point cloud data and voxel representations to enhance object recognition capabilities.
