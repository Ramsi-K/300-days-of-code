# Archived Sprint: Days 61-90 Highlights

1. **Luna-Net3D-Archived Data Validation and Visualization**: An intensive focus on ensuring data quality and alignment, developing scripts for voxel-to-lung validation, boundary checks, and comparative plotting of aligned and misaligned nodules in both 2D and 3D. This phase was crucial for cleaning up the dataset and ensuring accurate annotations.

2. **YOLOv3 Paper Implementation**: Started implementing YOLOv3 from scratch based on the original paper to understand the architecture of YOLO and its layers. YOLOâ€™s object detection architecture is an excellent candidate for applying nodule detection to the Luna-Net3D-Archived dataset. The work involved coding the layers, training on preliminary data, and drafting detailed notes on implementation.

3. **Exploring MLOps with ZoomCamp**: Completed Weeks 1 and 2 of the MLOps ZoomCamp course, covering foundational MLOps concepts, experiment tracking, and model management with MLflow. Weekly modules included hands-on exercises, implementing experiment tracking, and setting up a model registry to organize experiments and streamline model development.

4. **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation for Luna-Net3D-Archived**: Developed effective data transformations and resizing methods to improve data loading and training speeds. This involved extensive exploration of TorchIO for 3D data augmentation, implementing padding, resizing, and balancing methods, and tackling augmentation-related debugging challenges.
