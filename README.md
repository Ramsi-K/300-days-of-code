## <center>Coding Journey

Welcome to my 300-day coding challenge focused on vision technologies! This repository documents my daily coding efforts in the realm of computer vision, encompassing tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, classification, reinforcement learning, and GANs. I will also be solving DSA problems from LeetCode on some days to improve my python skills. The 300 days would also include some general python based projects to showcase and improve my skills. The goal is to actively code for at least 1 hour a day for 300 days in the year 2024.
