# Coding Journey

Welcome to my 300-day coding challenge focused on vision technologies! This repository documents my daily coding efforts in the realm of computer vision, encompassing tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, classification, reinforcement learning, and GANs. I will also be solving DSA problems from LeetCode on some days to improve my python skills. The 300 days would also include some general python based projects to showcase and improve my skills. The goal is to actively code for at least 1 hour a day for 300 days in the year 2024.

## Latest Update

### Basics of Reinforcement Learning on Custom Maze Environment

- **Date**: 2024-01-31

- **Task Description**: Today's task involved solving some LeetCode array problems. I solved [11-container-with-most-water](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/python-projects/tree/main/LeetCode-solutions/11-container-with-most-water) and [26-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/python-projects/tree/main/LeetCode-solutions/26-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array). My general feeling of LeetCode is that it is a terribly formatted resource. I find the way the questions are phrased to be purposefully unintuitive. I also do not like the white background theme. For [26-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/python-projects/tree/main/LeetCode-solutions/26-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array) why can we not simply return the length of the set of the list. Ridiculous! I have a nasty cold so maybe that's why I have no patience.


## Purpose

The primary objectives of this coding journey are:

1. **Showcasing Coding Abilities**: Demonstrate my coding skills through daily updates, ranging from small coding challenges to more extensive deep learning projects.

2. **Continuous Learning**: Actively engage in learning and improvement, exploring new concepts, algorithms, and frameworks within the field of computer vision.

3. **Building a Portfolio**: Create a comprehensive portfolio of projects and code snippets that highlight proficiency and growth in vision technologies.

## The Challenge

- **DailyLogs**: Daily log and description of task undertaken.

- **Projects**: Subfolders containing individual projects, each focused on a specific aspect of vision technologies.

- **CodingChallenges**: Code snippets or solutions from coding challenges, providing a mix of practical coding skills and problem-solving capabilities.
