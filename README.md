# Coding Journey

Welcome to my 300-day coding challenge focused on vision technologies! This repository documents my daily coding efforts in the realm of computer vision, encompassing tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, classification, reinforcement learning, and GANs.

## Latest Update

### Basics of Reinforcement Learning on Custom Maze Environment

- **Date**: 2024-01-28

- **Task Description**: Today's task involved delving into classic control tasks provided by Gymnasium, where I implemented and experimented with various reinforcement learning algorithms to understand their performance nuances. Additionally, I dedicated time to studying the theoretical underpinnings of Markov Decision Processes, Temporal Difference methods, Monte Carlo methods, and Q-Learning, deepening my understanding of these foundational concepts in reinforcement learning. 


## Purpose

The primary objectives of this coding journey are:

1. **Showcasing Coding Abilities**: Demonstrate my coding skills through daily updates, ranging from small coding challenges to more extensive deep learning projects.

2. **Continuous Learning**: Actively engage in learning and improvement, exploring new concepts, algorithms, and frameworks within the field of computer vision.

3. **Building a Portfolio**: Create a comprehensive portfolio of projects and code snippets that highlight proficiency and growth in vision technologies.

## The Challenge

- **DailyLogs**: Daily log and description of task undertaken.

- **Projects**: Subfolders containing individual projects, each focused on a specific aspect of vision technologies.

- **CodingChallenges**: Code snippets or solutions from coding challenges, providing a mix of practical coding skills and problem-solving capabilities.
