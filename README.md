## Status

Completed 198 of 300 days (200-day mark nearly reached).  
This repo is archived and serves as a record of 2024 Year 1 of 300 Days of Coding.
Year 2 continues in [300 Days of Code 2025](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/300-days-of-code_2025).

## Notes

This repo contains:

- Daily logs (main record of the challenge).
- Experiments with computer vision, reinforcement learning, and MLOps Zoomcamp.
- Early projects like **Notebookify** (no longer maintained).

## Retrospective

- Started strong with Computer Vision (LunaNet3D, YOLOv3, monocular depth).
- Explored MLOps Zoomcamp but didn‚Äôt complete.
- Spent a month on **Notebookify** ‚Üí learned I don‚Äôt use notebooks this way, project deprecated.
- Main win: consistent daily coding habit for 200 days.

## Final Update

The last task in this challenge was on 2024-08-29:  
[American Civil War Ciphers](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/python-projects/tree/main/Route-and-Rail-Ciphers)

Work included:

- Implemented and refined Route Cipher decryption
- Built brute-force key searcher for ciphers
- Implemented Rail Fence Cipher (encrypt + decrypt)
- Explored cipher classification and key dictionaries

This was logged as the final task of the challenge.  
The daily log ends at Day 198.

## 30-Day Sprints (Archived)

See [retrospectives/](./retrospectives) for detailed sprint notes. Sprint notes are available up to Day 180.  
These cover highlights for each 30-day block.  
Daily logs continue until Day 198, after which the challenge was wrapped.
