# 300-days-of-code
This repository is a 300-day coding challenge focused on vision technologies.  The repository serves as a comprehensive log of the journey, providing insights into the progress and evolution of skills.

# Coding Journey

Welcome to my 300-day coding challenge focused on vision technologies! This repository documents my daily coding efforts in the realm of computer vision, encompassing tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, classification, reinforcement learning, and GANs.

## Latest Update

### Basics of Reinforcement Learning on Custom Maze Environment

- **Date**: 2024-01-27

- **Task Description**: Created a Jupyter notebook to explore a custom Maze environment from Gymnasium. Explored basics of reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Process, using a random policy to achieve task completion.


## Purpose

The primary objectives of this coding journey are:

1. **Showcasing Coding Abilities**: Demonstrate my coding skills through daily updates, ranging from small coding challenges to more extensive deep learning projects.

2. **Continuous Learning**: Actively engage in learning and improvement, exploring new concepts, algorithms, and frameworks within the field of computer vision.

3. **Building a Portfolio**: Create a comprehensive portfolio of projects and code snippets that highlight proficiency and growth in vision technologies.

## The Challenge

- **DailyLogs**: Daily log and description of task undertaken.

- **Projects**: Subfolders containing individual projects, each focused on a specific aspect of vision technologies.

- **CodingChallenges**: Code snippets or solutions from coding challenges, providing a mix of practical coding skills and problem-solving capabilities.
