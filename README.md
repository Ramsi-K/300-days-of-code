## <center>Coding Journey

Welcome to my 300-day coding challenge focused on vision technologies! This repository documents my daily coding efforts in the realm of computer vision, encompassing tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, classification, reinforcement learning, and GANs. I will also be solving DSA problems from LeetCode on some days to improve my python skills. The 300 days would also include some general python based projects to showcase and improve my skills. The goal is to actively code for at least 1 hour a day for 300 days in the year 2024.

- **Task Description**:
Today, I dedicated my efforts to coding the [VQGAN (Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841) to model from scratch. The task involves meticulously translating the intricate details outlined in the research paper into functional code, including defining the architecture, implementing the training loop, and incorporating techniques like vector quantization and adversarial training. It is a challenging yet rewarding task that will allow me to deepen my understanding of generative modeling and neural network architectures.
<br/><br/>

## <center>Purpose

The primary objectives of this coding journey are:

1. **Showcasing Abilities**: Demonstrate my deep learning and coding skills through daily updates, ranging from small coding challenges to more extensive deep learning projects.

2. **Continuous Learning**: Actively engage in learning and improvement, exploring new concepts, algorithms, and frameworks within the field of computer vision.

3. **Building a Portfolio**: Create a comprehensive portfolio of projects and code snippets that highlight proficiency and growth in vision technologies.
