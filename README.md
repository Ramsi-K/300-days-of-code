## <center>Coding Journey

Welcome to my 300-day coding challenge focused on vision technologies! This repository documents my daily coding efforts in the realm of computer vision, encompassing tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, classification, reinforcement learning, and GANs. I will also be solving DSA problems from LeetCode on some days to improve my python skills. The 300 days would also include some general python based projects to showcase and improve my skills. The goal is to actively code for at least 1 hour a day for 300 days in the year 2024.

###  [GNNs](https://github.com/Ramsi-K/3D-Vision-Playground/tree/main/GNN)

**<p align="right">2024-03-26</p>**

- **Task Description**:
Over the past few days, I've been fully immersed in exploring the fascinating world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using PyTorch Geometric (PyG). Following the comprehensive course structure outlined by the official PyG resources, I've delved into various aspects of GNNs, from fundamental concepts like node and graph classification to advanced techniques such as spectral graph convolutional layers, aggregation functions, and graph autoencoders. Each day has been a deep dive into a different facet of GNNs, from data handling and graph generation to recurrent GNNs and edge analysis all through hands-on exploration and coding exercises. By understanding how GNNs can effectively model relationships in complex 3D data structures such as point clouds or voxel grids, I'm better prepared to leverage these techniques for tasks like 3D object detection, segmentation, and reconstruction. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between graph-based representation learning and the intricacies of 3D scene understanding, opening up exciting avenues for innovative solutions in the field of computer vision.
